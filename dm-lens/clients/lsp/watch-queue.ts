/**
 * Debounced `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` batching (#271).
 *
 * `handleNotifyOpen` previously sent one `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` per
 * file as each was opened. Many servers (TypeScript, …) kick off a project-wide
 * re-analysis on every such notification, so a turn that edits N files in one
 * project triggered ~N full re-analyses. This per-client queue coalesces the
 * changes within a short window and flushes them as a SINGLE notification, so the
 * server re-indexes once per burst instead of once per file.
 *
 * One queue lives per LSP client (= per serverId+root), so batching is naturally
 * scoped to a single server/project. Worst-case added latency before the server
 * learns of a change is the debounce window — negligible against the multi-second
 * re-analysis it gates.

 * missing-import survives Changed for the life of the server and clears on

 * already knew, so it is Changed.
 *
 * - The caller announces Created to one client at most once per path (the

 * - An unknown client start (`Infinity`) compares below the cutoff and falls
