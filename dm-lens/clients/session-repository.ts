/**
 * Which bytes belong to the session's own repository (#4530).
 *
 * One question, asked by every lookup that may start a file dm-lens did not
 * name itself: is this file (or this search-path directory) the session
 * repository's own bytes? Under pi trust other than `trusted`, those bytes
 * never answer a lookup. `isUntrustedProjectPath` is the judgment; the spawn
 * seam (`clients/safe-spawn.ts`), the global-bin lookup
 * (`clients/package-manager.ts`) and the LSP launcher ask it.
 *
 * The identity is fixed, never threaded by a caller: the session root is this
 * process's cwd, the one root pi's trust answer is about. A path is the
 * session repository's when its KERNEL-REAL path (realpath of the spelling,
 * no lexical `..` collapse first) is not in dm-lens's own data dir and:
 *
 * - lies at or under the session root, or
 * - lies under a project-local bin dir of an ancestor of the session root
 *   below HOME (a monorepo's hoisted `node_modules/.bin`), or
 * - belongs to a checkout that shares the session checkout's git commondir,
 *   when that checkout's root is not HOME or above: the session's own checkout above
 *   a subdirectory session, the main checkout, every linked worktree, and a
 *   `node_modules` linked into any of them.
 *
 * HOME is the ceiling throughout, the same one the project-local bin walk
 * stops at (#2514): a session started in HOME or above it owns nothing, and a
 * dotfiles repository rooted at HOME must not turn `~/.local/bin` into project
 * bytes. A session outside HOME (`/tmp/x`, `/srv/app`) is a project like any
 * other.
 *
 * This module sits beside the analysis-root class seam
 * (`clients/analysis-root.ts`) and reads the same git identity
 * (`review-graph/git-identity.ts`), but cannot live in it: `safe-spawn.ts`
 * imports this, and `analysis-root.ts` imports `file-utils.ts`, which imports
 * `safe-spawn.ts`. It imports only leaves.
