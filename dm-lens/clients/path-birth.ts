/**
 * #4320: when a PATH came into existence, as far as this process can tell.
 *
 * A language server needs a watched-files `Created` for a path it may hold a
 * failed lookup for, and only then (Pyrefly 1.3.2 keeps `import new_module`
 * missing until it hears Created). The inode's birth time answers "is this
 * file newer than the server?", but it is not the path's birth:
 *
 * - dm-lens's own partial edits replace the file through `writeFileAtomic`
 *   (temp file + rename), so an edited file gets a NEW inode and a new birth
 *   time. {@link noteAtomicReplace} records that the installed inode stands
 *   for a path born earlier, and {@link pathBirthtimeMs} answers with that
 *   earlier birth.
 * - A filesystem without a birth time reports 0, and Node on Linux without
 *   `statx` (kernels before 4.11, or a seccomp profile that blocks it) reports
 *   ctime as the birth time, which every in-place edit moves. Both make the
 *   birth unknown: {@link pathBirthtimeMs} returns `undefined` and leaves one
 *   degradation record per cause per session.
 *
 * - #4368 r1 row 13: a file moved into place (`mv`, a rename) keeps its inode
 *   and the inode's old birth, so it reads as older than the server that
 *   holds a failed lookup for its path. When dm-lens saw the path absent and
 *   later sees it present, the path was born in between: the import resolver
 *   ({@link notePathAppeared}) reports an import that resolved to nothing and
 *   now resolves to the path, and {@link pathBirthtimeMs} answers with that
 *   later observation.
 *
 * An editor or tool that replaces a file this way outside dm-lens leaves no
 * record, and its new inode reads exactly like a newly created file. Nothing
 * in a stat result tells the two apart.
